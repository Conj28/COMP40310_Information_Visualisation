All that was provided for this project was a selection of Data sets that we could choose from. From these the aim was to derive useful and insightful Visualisations from the complex raw data. 

Show above is my three submission which investigated questions relating to Broadway attendance in the period 2000 â€“ 2020.

All submissions are simple HTML pages utilising the Vega-lite visualisation Framework. 

For the project I received the grade of A+.
